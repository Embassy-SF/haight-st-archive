What began as a modest experiment with a spare bedroom in a community house has since evolved into a network of houses spanning multiple locations. The San Francisco location, situated at 399 Webster Street, has been continuously operational for over a decade, marking it as a long-standing experiment in communal living within the Bay Area.

### Key Individuals

- **Jessy Kate Schingler**: As a founder, Jessy Kate brings a unique perspective to community organization, describing Network life as being "immersed in a state of learning, sharing, and mutual support with others, [being] intentional with how I construct my everyday environment," and using "space as a platform for exploring new approaches to how we organize ourselves as humans." [[Embassy Network Blog](https://embassynetwork.com/blog)]

- **Zarinah Agnew**: Self-described as the "commune communista" at Embassy SF, Zarinah was drawn to The Embassy by its potential to build meaningful collaborative projects and its focus on "changing the way we live."

## Physical Space

### Building Characteristics

The Embassy is housed in a historic structure located at 399 Webster Street in San Francisco. Built in 1900, the early 20th-century mansion spans 5,850 square feet on a 0.11-acre lot. [[Redfin Property Details](https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Francisco/399-Webster-St-94117/home/902384)] The two-story, wood-constructed building is classified as a Single Family Residence/Townhouse with four full bathrooms, providing ample space for the community. Its substantial size and layout have made it ideally suited for adaptation into a co-living space that can comfortably accommodate approximately 18-20 residents.

### Notable Features

The physical space reflects the community's experimental nature. The house features a blend of shared and private rooms designed to balance communal interaction with personal space, acknowledging that "despite living in density, many of us are introverts." [[Embassy Network](https://embassynetwork.com)] According to media reports, the property includes some unexpected amenities, such as 3-D printers and a bowling alley in the basement.
