**Embassy Shared Cars**

[**Truck specific info**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lotDD1gM1AcoLgSU56N1Y4LsPH3wU60586xWr8ST47o/edit)  
[**Truck expenses**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfihl3BFWHqIf_S1Un8lD0oVc5bWu1RlCrdES4lR4M8/edit#gid=0)

**We have a shared truck at the embassy**  
The truck is a common cars used by residents & guests from other community houses only. This is bc it doesn’t scale if all people are able to use the cars and bc of the dissolved responsibility that comes when one is not a stakeholder in maintaining the commons. If a non-resident or an embassy guest wants to use one of the shared cars, the request is that you ask the owner of the car. (If you are a non-residents/guest and would like to use one of the cars see below\!)

**Booking the cars**  
Please check the google calendar to see if a car has been reserved and to make a reservation\! You can view this [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=NmtyY2g3NDNjcGpiOWtxbnIyMGE1YjR0YmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). Only residents can make bookings on this calendar. If you are non-residents/guest of the embassy please make sure to ask the car owner directly and then ask someone to make your reservation on the gcal. Join \#esf\_cars to check with the car users :) 

**Getting to the truck**  
Embassy address is 399 webster street. You can come in through the garage \- ask a resident for the codes. The key is stored in a wooden cabinet just inside the house from the garage. Please make sure to replace the key here when you come back. 

**Parking**

* The truck lives in the left hand side of garage on the inside if possible (with its nose touching the wall.   
* Please make sure that the cars do not cross the middle line of the garage as this makes it hard for others to park.   
* Please park as far away from the laundry area as you can as we need this space\!

**Ways to be celebrated and adored as a car user\!**

* Please refill the gas  
* Please empty trash out of the cars and leave them in a lovely state\!  
* Please always leave the keys on the hook\!  
* If you notice an engine light on or some other problem please let someone know\!  
* If you ding, scratch or damage the cars, it’s ok \- but please DO tell someone\!   
* Please make sure that the garage door has closed behind you, sometimes it almost closes and then bounces back up and ALL the bikes get nicked\!   
* Please do close the door between the garage and the house, this is where mice get into the trash bins\!  
* Please venmo zarinah @zarinah-agnew for any bridge tolls


**Things that have not been clearly defined**   
Please bear in mind that these things have not been clearly defined and that by using the cars, you are implicitly agreeing to participate in conversations about these issues if and when they might arise. 

* What happens if the cars need maintenance work?  
* What happens if you have an accident and the cars need repairs?  
* What happens if you get a parking or driving ticket?

This means that should you get into an accident, some maintenance work be needed, or you get a ticket/smashed window on your watch, that you are willing to work with us and the car owner to get to a solution. If you are not willing to participate in compassionate and understanding conversations about such things, perhaps consider not using the shared cars \<3. 

**Car insurance**   
AAA insurance

**Other insurance notes**  
:: they prefer the registered owner of the vehicle to also be the primary policy owner as otherwise they cannot guarantee that payouts get to the owner and not the primary name on the policy and this causes legal issues.  
:: can have co-owners but only a max of 2 allowed.  
:: we can set up a legal entity that can own the car and then the entity is named on the insurance.  
:: if we really want to set up a group policy we should try a local broker as they have more flexibility to design custom solutions.

**Long trips**  
If you want to take one of the cars overnight, please ask on slack first.
