“All models [of RJ] are to some extent culture-bound. So restorative justice should be built from the “bottom up,” by communities in dialogue and experimentation. Also, all models are to some extent culturebound. So restorative justice should be built from the “bottom up,” by communities in dialogue assessing their needs and resources and applying the principles to their own situations. “ - the little book of restorative justice

  

- Crime is a violation of people and of interpersonal relationships.
    
- Violations create obligations.
    
- The central obligation is to put right the wrongs.

Who has been hurt? ! What are their needs? ! Whose obligations are these?

  

The purpose of this program

The western legal or criminal justice system's approach to justice has some important strengths. Yet there is also a growing acknowledgment of this system's limits and failures. Victims, offenders and community members often feel that justice does not adequately meet their needs.

  

Here we aim to provide support for the grey area between going to the police and doing nothing. For people who decide not to go to the police, there is no restorative justice programs available, and no way to mediate a meeting with the accused. Given that *most* people don’t go to the police, this is a lot of people who have been assaulted, who have no channel to face their perpetrator and explain the consequences of their actions. 

  

Aims

- Unofficial documentation of accused individuals (how to do this ethically?)
    
- Provision of social and professional support
    
- Access to resources
    
- Victim oriented victim/offender mediation, despite the absence of a conviction. 
    
- Third party meeting with offender
    

  

Introduction

The term survivor/victim is used throughout to retain the empowerment conveyed by the word ""survivor"" and the outrage implied by the word ""victim."". The word offender is used to refer to the person responsible for perpetrating forced, unwanted sexual activity, without implying that an arrest has been made or charges issued. 

  

Restorative options include sharing circles, victim-offender dialogue, victim impact panels, community reparation boards, circles of support, sentencing circles, conferencing with juveniles and adults, and restorative discipline in educational settings (Umbreit et al., 2006).   Restorative interventions may occur at multiple time points. 

  

We strongly encourage interested readers to read more broadly about restorative justice and offer the following references as starting points:   philosophy, roots, and vision of restorative justice (Johnstone & Van Ness, 2006; Umbreit et al., 2006) 

  

What do victims need?

A consensus of published studies is that survivor/victims need to tell their own stories about their experiences, obtain answers to questions, experience validation as a legitimate victim, observe offender remorse for harming them, receive support that counteracts isolation and self-blame, and above all have choice and input into the resolution of their violation. 

  

What does society need?

A way to check behaviours and acts that are not reported to the police.

Restorative justice is not primarily about forgiveness or reconciliation.

Restorative justice is not mediation

Restorative justice is not primarily designed to reduce recidivism

Restorative justice is not a particular program or a blueprint

  
  

Our commitment

We provide a group of individuals who are: 

* responsible for following up on incidents, at specific points in time for both the actor and the target. 

* able to provide mental health support, resources, a safe space in our home

* be available for mediation if requested between parties or on behalf of individuals
