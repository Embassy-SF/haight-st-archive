Thank you for your time with us\! This document is just a reminder to make space for offboarding, to hear thoughts and reflections. 

**Some prompts that might help are:**   
Why are you leaving, what takes you to other places?  
What kinds of things did the embassy provide for you? What was good? Did it help change or prod you in unexpected ways?   
In what ways might it have been better/dug deeper?   
Are there any other unresolved issues for you in the community?  
What things might you change, if you had ultimate POWER?  
What experiments might you deploy?  
Are there difficult or crucial conversations that are not being had? 

***Returning Resident Policy***  
On leaving the Embassy for other projects and pastures, we ask that you please always remain part of the community but not under the expectation that there will always be automatically be room for you in the house. We ask that as you leave the community, that there be a conversation with the house about expectations around return. 

Some of the many reasons for this include:   
a) there may be new residents in the house who donâ€™t know you  
	b) new residents would like a chance to bring in new people, and there not be a backlog of returning housemates that prevent this  
c) the ecology of the house and community needs is ever changing, and we hope to reflect on what the community needs at any given time, not to assume that a person will always be the right addition for the community.
